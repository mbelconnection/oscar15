Download and install the Required Files

Allow partner repository by sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list and uncommenting
	#deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu lucid partner

Then install the software.
	sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk ant-optional mysql-server libmysql-java tomcat6 tomcat6-admin cvs

Edit the /etc/profile file
	sudo vi /etc/profile

Add these lines to end of the file.
	JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun"
	CATALINA_HOME="/usr/share/tomcat6"
	CATALINA_BASE="/var/lib/tomcat6"
	ANT_HOME="/usr/share/ant"
	export JAVA_HOME CATALINA_HOME CATALINA_BASE ANT_HOME

Load the new environment variables into your existing terminal.
	source /etc/profile

Anonymous CVS checkout of the source (main trunk)
	mkdir -p $HOME/src/oscar_source
	cd $HOME/src/oscar_source
	cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@oscarmcmaster.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/oscarmcmaster login
	cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@oscarmcmaster.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/oscarmcmaster co -P oscar_mcmaster
	cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@oscarmcmaster.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/oscarmcmaster logout

Compile OSCAR.
	cd $HOME/src/oscar_source/oscar_mcmaster/build
	ant

Copy the resulting WAR files to the web server.
	sudo cp $HOME/src/oscar_source/oscar_mcmaster/build/tmp/*.war $CATALINA_BASE/webapps

Populate the MySQL database replacing ****** with your MySQL password.
	cd $HOME/src/oscar_source/oscar_mcmaster/database/mysql
	./createdatabase_on.sh root ****** oscar_mcmaster
(for BC use ./createdatabase_bc.sh root ****** oscar_mcmaster instead)

You will need to move the *.properties and backup.sh files to $CATALINA_HOME as below.
	sudo cp $HOME/src/oscar_source/oscar_mcmaster/install/oscar*.properties $CATALINA_HOME
	sudo cp $HOME/src/oscar_source/oscar_mcmaster/install/backup.sh $CATALINA_HOME
	sudo ln -s $CATALINA_HOME/oscar_mcmaster.properties $CATALINA_HOME/oscar.properties

The oscar.properties file needs to be localized for your specific configuration following the comments in the file.
	sudo vi $CATALINA_HOME/oscar.properties

Now we’ll enable the new echart interface.
	cd $HOME/src/oscar_source/oscar_mcmaster/database/mysql
	java -cp .:$CATALINA_BASE/webapps/oscar/WEB-INF/lib/mysql-connector-java-3.0.11-stable-bin.jar importCasemgmt $CATALINA_HOME/oscar.properties

Restart tomcat
	sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat6 restart

At this point http://YourOscarServerIP:8080/oscar will give you the login page.
SSL, Drugref, OscarFax, OscarCom, MyOscar, Backup, Mule and program setup can (and often should) be done to finish the installation.
