<br><br>Re: Missed Appointment Notice
<br><br>Dear ##first_last_name##
<br><br>It is noted that you missed your scheduled appointment. Missing an appointment causes great disruptions for many reasons:
<ol><li>The team member assigned to see you has a period of 'wasted time' in his/her schedule.
</li><li>Time taken by the team member to prepare for your visit is wasted.
</li><li>A patient who has need of an appointment is prevented from being scheduled.
</li></ol>
<p>We understand that circumstances may arise that make keeping an appointment difficult or impossible. However, it is important for you to understand the consequences of missed appointments. To minimize the effect of missed appointments, we ask that you cancel an appointment by notifying the receptionist 24 hours prior to your scheduled appointment. Doing so will enable the ##clinic_name## to continue to deliver efficient health care to those in need. Please note that someone who habitually misses appointments may be charged a fee. 

<p>Yours Sincerely</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
