Electronic Asthma Action Plan
=============================

Setup Instructions
------------------

EAAPS depends on OSCAR studies and OSCAR lab uploads. Before eAAPs feature can be used, the 
both of the dependencies must be configured.

Configuring OSCAR Labs
----------------------

Steps 1-3 are optional in case OSCAR keys have already been generated. 

1. Create OSCAR key by going to Admin > Key Gen
2. Type in:
	Service Name: oscar
	Lab type: other
	Message Type: oscar
3. Click "Create Key Pair"

This should create default OSCAR keys, in case they haven't been generated.

4. Now create service keys using the same page (Admin > Key Gen)
5. Type in:
	Service NAme: eaaps
	Lab type: other
	Message Type: eaaps
6. Click "Create Key Pair". This should present a "Save the file" dialog, which provides the
required keys for use with OSCAR lab upload protocol.

Configuring eAAPs Study
----------------------

1. Open study interface by going to Admin > Misc > Study
2. Create a new study by clicking "New Study"
3. Enter study details (can be any, as long as they can identify the right user group)

demographics" button to open it from the Study admin page)
