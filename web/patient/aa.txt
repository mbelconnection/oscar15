These are the menu functions:
Emergency Record - Show the Patient Summary screen for now.
Self Assessment - Show AR1 with risk checklist (great demo!)
Smart Checkup - Show AR2  with checklist (this too is great demo!)
Make Appointment - Show "Please call your clinic receptionist to obtain
permission for Internet Booking."
Mail Us - Show "Your message: text box" with Submit /Cancel buttons in 
the
bottom
Finish & Exit - Logout

Notice this is all done without javascript. I intend to keep this part
low-bandwidth and compliant with everything under the sun!
Regarding the Report page, what would be most flexible is to build a
datadict.xml record (which you can Edit in Preference) which looks something
like this:
<Data_Dictionary_Name>Name
     <Source_table>Demo</Source_table>
     <Row>Row or field name</Row>
     <Conversion>if conversion needed</Conversion>
</Data_dictionary_Name>

<Data_Dictionary_Name>EDB
     <Source_table>AR1 or wherever you can get the latest
data</Source_table>
     <Row>Row or field name or xml tag name</Row>
     <Conversion>if conversion needed for the date field</Conversion>
</Data_dictionary_Name>

etc.. At the end of the day, you provide a program which will extra data
from the database and dynamically create a mySQL table. The Report page is
just a list of reports which are SQL commands. Later you can provide a
facility to allow user to add report by learning from the sample reports you
give them. When you execute SQL commands, disable any DELETE type commands.
Let's work on this a bit more. This is bread and butter of a data-management
system. If you can export the extracted data to another subdirectory where
users can use standard reporting program (hopefully also Open Source,
something like Crystal Reports if we have to pay) that will be GREAT!
